# Sports App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.7.

## Development

First, create a `.env` file and add variables:

* `VITE_SERVER_URL={server_host:server_port}`
* `VITE_STATIC_URL=files`

Second, for correct display of map images create symbolic link
from backend application `your_path/sports-app-backend/envs/tmp/files`
to current folder `your_path/sports-app-fronted/files`.

Finally, run `dev` for a dev server.

## Build

Run `build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Don't forget about the `.env` file with url variables.
